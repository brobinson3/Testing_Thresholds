## Testing_Thresholds

This code was used for the computational work in the following paper:

Robinson, B., & Herman, J. D. (2018). A framework for testing dynamic classification of vulnerable scenarios in ensemble water supply projections. Climatic Change, 1-18. (found at: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-018-2347-3)

The CMIP5 downscaled streamflow projections can be found at ftp://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/pub/dcp/archive/cmip5/hydro/routed_streamflow/. The projections used for this paper are in the folder "cmip5_ncar_mon", and the historical flows used are in the folder "historical_maurer02". The original list of the sites included and their five-letter codes is in the file marked NCAR_cmip5_streamflow_sites.txt, however a list of only the sites used for this study and their relevant data is in this repository (Sites_Master_List_Final.csv).

# Sites_Master_List_Final.csv

Only the first column (river name codes) of this file is used for the main code. Other information here is used for drawing the map and to keep track of additional data sources.
